# Godot-Base-Template
A basic game template for the Godot engine, featuring functionalities that nearly all games would require, such as customizable video/audio/control settings, basic main menu and UI, and other misc. pieces of code.

## Can I use this?
This code is freely available for anyone to make use of. I mainly created this template for my own use, as it would make starting new projects easier due to not having to re-write these basic functionalities. As such, I don't expect to do much activate maintenance or updating, unless I find it useful for myself. Therefore, be aware that this template could be out-of-date, should the engine be updated. **The current supported version is Godot 4.2.1.**
